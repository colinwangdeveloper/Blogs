# Blogs
This is a repository to place all my blogs, so that I can look back in the future.

It's public, everyone can comment on my blogs.

So, 
## Who am I?
My name is Colin, I've worked as a Java Developer for 3 years, then went to Australia and completed my master study. After that, I found a job as a "Full Stack Developer" in Australia, after 2 years' working, the company faced a fanancial difficulty, so put many people in the redundency list, I'm one of them. Now looking for a new role.

## Why I start this blog?
I worked as a "Full Stack Developer" in that company for 2 years, in this position, I mainly did front end works, building website for our clients which mostly are government departments. 
After covid years, Australia government decided to ruduce it's expenditure, which affected related companies, under this situation, my company had to start it's redundency process. Unfortunately, I was in the redundency list.
So I have to start to find a new job ---- after buying my first house recently. 
To pay my home loan, I have to do many other jobs like kitchen hand, warehouse worker. 
One day I found that I haven't do coding stuff for a long time, then I dicided to start it with recording everything I did. That's why I create a repository to be a blog project.

Hope I can find an IT job recently! Good luck to me!
